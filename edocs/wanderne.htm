Since my removal to south Germany, I have it naturally not far up to the Alps. The first time I went to the Berchtesgadener Alps and was
inspired. Now we were in Allgaeu, personally I find this region very cool.
<p>Here you find some <a href="../docs/touren.htm">routes</a> I made last time. Sorry, only german language.
