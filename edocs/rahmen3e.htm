Hi everyboby, you are now at my homepage :-)).
<br>
&nbsp;
<p>This site is still at work, because I cannot invest so much time to
do all I wan't; additionally there are different projects which must be
terminated. In the current version some points are gradually implemented
such as building of loudspeakers, hifi tubes and mountains.
</p>
<p>Briefly to copyright: I have, so far possible, contacted the authors
of the used text and pictures, unfortunately not always with response.
If someone has problems thereby, please contact me and the picture concerned
will be removed.
<br>

<p>Have fun and don't take care of my english...
