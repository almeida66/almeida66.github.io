Security in the internet - <font size=+0>or howto install a firewall router
at home</font></h3>

<p><br>Think about it:&nbsp; <b><i>Everyone who connects to internet is
part of World Wide Web!</i></b>
<br>So you can be hacked. Have a look at <a href="http://www.guninski.com">Georgi
Guninski</a> demo pages. Here he shows for example your harddisk contents.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the used adjustments of your browser and naturally
which pages you visit. But without Java you won't see very much on display.
By assignment of dynamic IP addresses by your provider the normal user
is also further on the safe side.</p>
<p>The normal user (to which I also count myself) has a computer, standard
software and modem/ISDN. Everyone, which
<br>pursues the press releases, hears e.g. of internet attacks on Yahoo,
download monitoring by Microsoft etc.</p>
<p>What about the acquisition of a firewall solution ? What is that? Freely
translated&nbsp; <i>firewall</i> is a protection against unauthorized penetration
e.g. in a local network. There are many possibilities howto realize this
from a firewall router
<br>to proxy firewall.</p>
<p>What do you need? In this example: 2 network cards, 1 crossover cable
and a second computer (like 486 with 8MB RAM). Costs approx. 70,- DM and
your old computer taken from the cellar : -)</p>
<p>I'm not a programmer, so I looked for free solutions and found this
small listing:</p>

etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>The above mentioned programs are naturally :) based on linux, which
fit on 1 (-3) floppy disk and work even without harddisk. Who absolutely
wants Microsoft based software, he should try the <a href="http://www.janaserver.de">Jana-server</a>
. For comparison test the free lightversion of
<a href="http://www.gnatbox.com">GNATbox</a>
.</p>
<p>Who has a second high performance computer, can naturally use a full
linux distribution to get a similar protection with
<br><a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a>, ipfwadm and tcpd. However
you decides, I use <a href="http://www.freesco.org">FREESCO</a> and I'm
very happy with it.</p>
<p>FREESCO has the advantage to fit only on one disk and it works already
with a 386SX. It is recommended to work with 486 and 16MB RAM; I use only
8MB RAM, but I create swapfile on harddisk.</p>
<p>How to do?
<p>Download image, driver and rawrite files to DOS environment and create
install floppy. Insert networt cards and run configuration; on the small(!)
computer you need only DOS and modem attached. Boot from floppy and after
usual root/root identification, run <b>setup</b>.</p>
<p>Network cards according to 3Com and Ne2000 or compatible are detected,
otherwise you need the driver file. IRQ adjustments of modern network cards
are often determined by software. It's recommended to give a fixed address
like io=0x280, irq=5.</p>
<p>For use on harddisk just type <b>move2hdd</b>; software is installed
on a umsdos environment and should be started by execution of&nbsp; <b>router.bat</b>.
Take care, never edit this files in DOS session!</p>
<p>The whole configuration is easily and described in developers <a href="http://www.freesco.org">documentation</a>
. Documentation is not finished yet, because software is still beta, but
works fine for most people.</p>
<p>The main difficulty is the configuration of clients (here Win9x); I
also stopped here for first time... You only need to install TCP/IP ! The
hopefully correctly detected network card needs the following adjustments:
IP address (192.168.xxx.xxx), at gateway and DNS the IP address of <u>router</u>
(192.168.xxx.yyy), as domain according to default setting enter <i>inet</i>
and as hostname e.g. <i>router.inet</i>. The client should also have a
name, entry somewhere under network/identification.</p>
<p>Thats it. Restart both computer and test the connection with <b>ping</b>
192.168.xxx.yyy on client. Then start your favorite browser and type router
address, port 82 (192.168.xxx.yyy:82). Voil&aacute;, the <a href="http://www.acme.com">httpd</a>
should know be there! Yes, this software offers also an administration
by webclient. Do you want to test your homepage layout under "real" conditions
? Then activate httpd under <b>setup/advanced</b> for external world and
place your files under /mnt/www.</p>
<p>At present the software offers the following: DNS -, DHCP -, time-,
telnet-, web-, print and Remote Access server services.
<p>For harddisk installation extensions like database
<a href="http://www.Hughes.com.au">mSQL</a>
or <a href="http://www.gnome.org">MidnightCommander</a> are possible.
You may consider the use of&nbsp; libc5-libraries and placing binaries
under /mnt/router/rc as well as the adjustment of <i>rc_user</i> file.
The system operates completely in RAM, so root directory
<b>/</b> is quasi
virtual and it will be rebuild every restart. All modifications in the
root directory are lost.</p>
<p>Check out your mini net with <a href="ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html">satan</a>,
<a href="http://www.wwdsi.com/saint">saint</a>
or <a href="http://www.nessus.org">nessus</a> . And don't forget to change
all passwords.</p>
<p>Well, sunday afternoon is saved and surfing the WWW is a bit more secure.</p>
