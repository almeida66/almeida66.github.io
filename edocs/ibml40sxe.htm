<p>This page results on a request concerning Linux on the L40SX.</p>
<p>First, you need the reference disks from <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/support">IBM</a>-support
site; now install a minimum DOS. With the newer version of <b>fips</b>
it won't be a problem; for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040215092119/http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/linux-distrib-small.html">mini-Linux
distributions</a> you may need a minimum of 20MB diskspace, better 40MB
+ swapspace. Maybe you wan't to upgrade your harddisk with a standard 2,5"
(take care of 512 limit).</p>
<p>With the standard 2MB RAM it becomes very laborious; but hey, you can
<b>modify</b> a standard 4MB-PARITY-module (1MBx36) and plug it into your
L40SX. See how to do this at <a href="http://members.aol.com/mcapage0/memory01.htm">MCA-Enthusiasts
Page</a>. Thanks to Peter H. Wendt, it works :-))!</p>
<p>Well, you don't want to do that ? So you may try&nbsp; <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121101051622/http://www.superant.com/smalllinux/">Small
Linux</a>&nbsp; version 0.7 with the kernel from <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>
1.3.1, taken from the special <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/dists/Debian-1.3.1/main/disks-i386/1997-10-13/special/tecra">bootdisks</a>
for Thinkpads. Why ? The L40SX has problems with the "refreshing of A20
gate" (don't ask me why) like some ThinkPads and a standard kernel won't
boot.</p>
<p>Write the install disks with <b>rawrite</b> or <b>dd</b> and read the
info pages from the developer howto copy them to harddisk. Remember: you
must change the kernel against the patched one from Debian! Don't forget
to copy the support disk, too.</p>
<p>If you have already tried another distribution and you can't reboot
after first installation, you should load it with the mentioned special
kernel. I use the base diskset from the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian
libc5-distribution</a> version 1.3.1. Maybe you wan't to use your CD driver,
then you create a <b>plip</b>-connection to your computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, I use a modified memory-module to update my laptop.</p>
<p>Get a 4MB PS/2-module with parity and check pin 67 to 70 with a multimeter.
Pin 69 and 70 must be set to ground (pin 72), pin 67 and 68 must be open
(no contact). Remove or add the Zero-ohm-resistors somewhere on the side
with a soldering iron. That's it !</p>
<p>You need to enlarge the hole on the module to fit into memory connector,
or you simply cut the nose on the connector; check out the module. Last,
you will get a 164-Error and now you need the reference-disk to change
memory size.</p>
<p>My modified module works fine in the second connector, don't ask me
why. Two 4MB modules won't work and I have not hear about a successful
modified 8MB module.</p>
<p><b><i>All tips given and all the described modifications are 'On Own
Risk'. The maintainer will give no warranty of any kind !</i></b></p>
<p>I use a modified 8 chips Kingston module, it works; a original 3 chips
IBM module don't work. Don't give up !</p>
