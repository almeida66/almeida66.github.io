<pre>You might be interested in my success (with some minor fiddles) in installing
Debian on a PS/2 (forwarded from debian-user)

 -------


I am attempting a Debian install on an IBM PS/2 Model 70, with the standard
1.3 (might be 1.3.1) rescue disk.

The kernel recognises the IBM ESDI disks, but I had to do

mknod /dev/eda b 36 0
mknod /dev/eda1 b 36 1
mknod /dev/eda2 b 36 2

Also dinstall does not recognise /dev/eda as a local drive, so I have used the
second window to do the fdisk and mke2fs

The next problem is that fdisk -l does not recognise eda disks, even though
fdisk /dev/eda does work.

(This is being reported in the order I found it, there may be a better order)

I got round this by doing (in the other window)

fdisk /dev/eda >/tmp/fdisk
and then p, to list the partition table and q to quit.

I then edited the resulting /tmp/fdisk

With this I could enable swap, and eventually mount the root partition
(you have to keep recreating /tmp/fdisk because dinstall keeps overwriting it)

I have now reached the stage where it is installing the base set, so hopefully
everything will be OK from here.

p.s. it would be useful to have some way (not nescessarily obvious) to
re-execute dinstall, for people who have edited it in the second window -
I havent really looked into exactly how it is started

Note that I also had to repeat the mknods on the final target disk, and that
at present I am booting from a boot disk as I havent yet got LILO set up.</pre>
